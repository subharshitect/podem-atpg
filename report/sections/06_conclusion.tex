\section{Limitations and Future Work}
This implementation targets combinational circuits and gate-output faults only. Future work could add support for sequential circuits via time-frame expansion, handle fanout-branch faults, implement fault collapsing, improve XOR/XNOR backtrace heuristics, and introduce advanced implication/learning for deeper circuits.
