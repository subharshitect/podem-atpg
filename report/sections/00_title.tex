\section*{Project Overview}
This report documents a Python implementation of the PODEM (Path-Oriented Decision Making) algorithm for Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) on combinational circuits with single stuck-at faults. The implementation targets gate-output faults only and uses five-valued logic to model discrepancies between the good and faulty circuits.
