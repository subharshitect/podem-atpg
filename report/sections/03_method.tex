\section{Method}
The algorithm alternates between two goals: activating the fault site and propagating the fault effect to a primary output. If the fault is not activated, the objective sets the fault net to the opposite of its stuck value. Once activated, the objective selects a D-frontier gate and assigns a non-controlling value to an unassigned input to enable propagation. Backtrace maps objectives to primary inputs by traversing gate inputs and accounting for inversions. Implication assigns the selected primary input value and performs forward evaluation in topological order. If the current assignment fails, the algorithm backtracks and tries the complement, terminating when a test is found or the search space is exhausted.
